The lightning-caused fire started in aspen and pine trees June 3 in a remote area about 10 miles north of Gardner in the San Isabel National Forest. Twenty-four firefighters are assigned to fire, which as burned 162 acres. There is limited access to the rugged area, however crews are currently conducting ""blacklining"" activities - pre-burning areas near the control line, which creates a safe area for crews to work.  While few values are at risk, and no evacuations have been ordered, firefighters intend to fully suppress the fire. Today's forecast for the area calls for gusty winds and more lightning, however chances for rain will increase during the week. Last year, the Spring Fire in Huerfano County burned over 100,000 acres, creating ongoing flood concerns for La Veta and Walsenburg. Large burn scars heavily contribute to flash flood risk from intense storms. The danger can last for years.""",2019-07-01T03:01:05Z,2019-07-01T03:01:05Z,0,"""disaster,fire,wildfire""",disasters,America/Denver,US,"""37.919,-105.142""",,,locality,70,,,active,2019-07-01T03:05:18Z,,

Mary Rosenbleeth said no one aboard the twin-engine plane survived at the Addison Municipal Airport, about 20 miles north of Dallas. The Beechcraft BE-350 King Air hit an unoccupied hangar soon after 9 a.m., according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The agency said that the blaze destroyed the plane but could not confirm how many people were aboard Sunday evening. The video showed black smoke billowing from the building and a gaping hole in the hangar. Officials have not released the identities of the people who died. Rosenbleeth said the Dallas County medical examiner's office confirmed the fatalities to the town and that authorities are still working to notify the families of the victims. An official with the medical examiner's office told The Associated Press they could not release any information on the crash Sunday evening. The plane crashed during takeoff and the resulting fire was quickly extinguished, said Edward Martelle, a spokesman for the town immediately north of Dallas. Dallas County was helping the city of Addison set up a family assistance center for people affected by the crash, Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said. ""It's a very sad day for Dallas County,"" he told the Dallas Morning News. ""My prayers are with the families we're notifying about this tragedy."" Addison fire spokesman Edward Martelle said the plane was taking off at the south end of the airport and had just lifted off the runway when it veered left, dropped its left wing and went into the hangar. The fire department had extinguished the fire and all hot spots at the hangar by early afternoon. FAA and National Transportation Safety Board officials were at the crash site Sunday evening. Martelle said NTSB will be leading the investigation and that they intend to work into the night. The plane's tail number and details from the flight manifest have not yet been released.""",2019-07-01T03:16:06Z,2019-07-01T03:16:06Z,0,"""disaster,vehicle-accident""",disasters,America/Chicago,US,"""32.969972,-96.836467""",,,locality,90,,,active,2019-07-01T03:20:29Z,,

County Fire spokesperson Kyle Hauducoeur told the Leader on Sunday afternoon that the male pilot and female passenger were en route to Chino from Needles in the fixed-wing plane when the plane's engine lost oil pressure and stalled, which brought an emergency landing. ""The plane crashed ... in a very remote section of the preserve,"" Hauducoeur said, adding that the location had no viable road access. The Mojave National Preserve is a sprawling, 1.5 million-acre swath of mostly protected federal land within the National Park System. It's sandwiched by Interstate 15 to the north, Interstate 40 to the south and the California-Nevada state line to the east. The plane crashed near the unincorporated High Desert community of Ludlow, situated roughly 58 miles east of Barstow on I-40, according to a County Fire statement released shortly before 6:30 p.m. Sunday. Neither occupant was injured. The man and woman faced a four- to five-mile hike to the nearest road, or a long wait for ground resources to reach them, County Fire's statement showed. Despite the location, the pilot used a cellphone to make a call that established communication with a San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department patrol helicopter. Once Sheriff's officials confirmed the man and woman were not injured, they ""allowed (County Fire's) response to continuing,"" Hauducoeur said. The first-alarm incident response included an H-325 MedFlight helicopter contracted to County Fire. The crew flew the H-325 from the Southern California Logistics Airport in Victorville to the crash site. There, the long wait and 100-degree heat prompted the crew to take the couple to the Barstow-Daggett Airport located about 40 miles west of Ludlow in order to get them out of the elements and to arrange for their transport home, the statement showed. A photo posted to County Fire's Twitter account shortly after 2 p.m. Sunday showed the couple in good spirits, smiling in front of the H-325 at the crash site. A second photo showed the man giving a thumbs up while posing with the helicopter crew. County Fire's statement called the H-325 a ""critical resource"" that ""made a difference"" with its capacity for off-site landings and auto-launching to calls along remote stretches of I-15 and I-40, as well as highways 58 and 395, when necessary. ""I would consider them very lucky,"" Hauducoeur said of the couple.""",2019-07-01T10:54:02Z,2019-07-01T10:54:02Z,0,"""disaster,vehicle-accident""",disasters,America/Los_Angeles,US,"""35.010991,-115.473355""",,,locality,70,,,active,2019-07-01T10:55:27Z,,

The Menlo Park Fire Protection District received a hazardous material report at 10:58 a.m. at the facility at 1195 Hamilton Court. FBI investigators and a hazardous materials crew responded to the scene. Late Monday afternoon, crews from San Mateo County and the National Guard, all wearing protective gear, entered the building to conduct tests on the substance. Facebook officials said the suspicious package was delivered to one of the company's mail rooms. Four buildings were evacuated as officials investigated, but three were cleared for people to return Monday afternoon, Facebook spokesman Anthony Harrison said. ""The safety of our employees is our top priority,"" he said. Officials would not say what the substance might be, but a fire dispatcher relayed over the police scanner that Facebook personnel had reported detecting sarin gas, a powerful nerve agent. Five people were in the building when the package was discovered and two of them may have been exposed to the substance, said Menlo Park Fire Marshal Jon Johnston. No one showed any symptoms of an illness, he said. ""We need to go in and actually test the product to verify whether or not there's a concern,"" Johnston said. At least two fire trucks and an ambulance were stationed outside the facility Monday afternoon, and U.S. Postal Inspection Service investigators were also on scene. Officials partially shut down the parking lot and roads within the business complex with caution tape. ""We're waiting on other resources to be able to do the testing,"" Johnston said. ""Right now everything's looking good, no signs or symptoms."" Sarin is an odorless, colorless liquid that can be used as a nerve agent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is not found naturally in the environment. People exposed to sarin may experience symptoms such as nausea, confusion, sweating, muscle twitching, loss of consciousness, convulsions, paralysis and respiratory failure. Facebook officials sent pizzas to the emergency responders at the scene. Facebook bought the shipping warehouse, along with 20 nearby buildings, for $395 million in 2015 from an affiliate of Prologis, a San Francisco industrial landlord, according to property records. This year, the social media giant proposed a massive real estate project on the site called Willow Village. It would include 1.75 million square feet of office space, 1,500 housing units, a hotel and open space. Existing industrial buildings would be demolished. The city is reviewing the plan.""",2019-07-02T02:52:09Z,2019-07-02T02:52:09Z,0,"""disaster""",disasters,America/Los_Angeles,US,"""37.485071,-122.147424""",,,locality,90,,,active,2019-07-02T02:55:17Z,,
5,5,5,5,5,5,5,g2M3VZWQRd4haaGfkv,Volcano Activity - North-America - USA,"""HawaiiVolcanic Activity Summary: For the past several months, earthquake and ground deformation rates at Mauna Loa Volcano have exceeded long term background levels. An eruption is not imminent and current rates are not cause for alarm. However, they do indicate changes in the shallow magma storage system at Mauna Loa. Following a significant earthquake swarm in October 2018, HVO seismic stations have recorded an average of at least 50 shallow, small-magnitude earthquakes per week beneath Mauna Loa's summit, upper Southwest Rift Zone, and upper west flank. This compares to a rate of fewer than 20 per week in the first half of 2018. Shallow earthquakes are occurring in locations similar to those that preceded Mauna Loa's most recent eruptions in 1975 and 1984.  During this same time period, GPS instrumentation and satellite radar have measured ground deformation consistent with renewed recharge of the volcano's shallow magma storage system. The current rate and pattern of ground deformation is similar to that measured during inflation of Mauna Loa in 2005 and again from 2014 - 2018. Together, these observations indicate the volcano is no longer at a background level of activity. Accordingly, HVO is elevating the Mauna Loa alert level to ADVISORY and the aviation color code to YELLOW.  This increase in alert level does not mean that an eruption is imminent nor that progression to an eruption is certain. A similar increase in activity occurred between 2014 and 2018 and no eruption occurred.""",2019-07-02T18:30:28Z,2019-07-02T18:30:28Z,0,"""disaster,volcano""",disasters,Pacific/Honolulu,US,"""19.472139,-155.592207""",,,locality,70,,,active,2019-07-02T18:35:24Z,,

I looked outside and it was almost like the world was ending,"" said Alex Carver, who works at a deli across the street from the explosion. ""It was nuts, man. It was crazy."" The Plantation fire department called it a gas explosion. The blast scattered large pieces of concrete as far as 50 yards (46 meters) away and sent pieces of metal as far as 100 yards (91 meters) across the street. Carver said two of his co-workers' cars were destroyed. The explosion demolished the building, leaving behind only part of its metal frame. It blew out the windows of a popular fitness club next door. Dozens of firefighters responded and could be seen picking through the rubble with dogs sniffing through the debris. There were no known fatalities immediately after the explosion, said police officer Chavez Grant. Of the 20 injured, two were seriously hurt. The Plantation fire and police departments said on Twitter that the street was closed to traffic. The fire department called it a gas explosion with ""multiple patients.""""",2019-07-07T03:14:26Z,2019-07-07T03:14:26Z,0,"""disaster,explosion""",disasters,America/New_York,US,"""26.127586,-80.233104""",,,locality,70,,,active,2019-07-07T03:15:17Z,,

Trona resident Ivan Amerson said there was ""significant damage,"" with some houses knocked off their foundations. State officials said they had heard reports of at least one structure collapse. The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said there were numerous gas leaks and that deputies were helping with evacuations. Ridgecrest police said Trona is in need of water and urged people to make donations at the police station. Caltrans said Highway 178 in the Kern River Canyon area was closed because of rockslides. Just before 1 a.m. Saturday, Kern County announced that Highway 178 through the canyon had been cleared in both directions, according to bakersfield.com. Trona is near the epicenter of Thursday's 6.4 magnitude temblor, which damaged roads and some homes. The town has about 1,500 residents, many of whom work at the Searles Valley Minerals plant or the local high school. After Thursday's quake, officials said their main priority was checking the industrial plant. The site produces materials such as boric acid, sodium carbonate, sodium sulfate and several specialty forms of borax used in soaps and other industrial materials.""",2019-07-07T04:37:20Z,2019-07-07T04:37:20Z,0,"""disaster,earthquake""",disasters,America/Los_Angeles,US,"""35.767454,-117.403947""",,,locality,90,,,active,2019-07-07T04:40:18Z,,

An adjacent building - described by Martinez as the company's main operations building there - had minor heat damage, she said. Work at the facility has been paused until the necessary repairs are made, Martinez said. The cause of the fire is under investigation, SpaceX spokesman James Gleeson said in a statement. Martinez said the fire is estimated to have done $50,000 to $100,000 of damage. The Fire Department received a call about the fire at 12:19 p.m. Eastern Time. The first unit arrived on the scene two minutes later, and the fire was extinguished by 12:33 p.m., Martinez said.
